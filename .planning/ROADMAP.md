#### Phase 30: OID Map Integrity

**Goal**: Operators can detect configuration errors in oidmaps.json at load time, and any code that needs to reverse-resolve a metric name to its OID can do so via a stable interface method
**Depends on**: Nothing (foundation for Phase 31)
**Requirements**: MAP-01, MAP-02, MAP-03, MAP-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Loading an oidmaps.json with a duplicate OID key produces a structured log warning per duplicate that names the OID, both conflicting metric names, and which name was retained — no silent last-write-wins clobber
  2. Loading an oidmaps.json with a duplicate metric name value produces a structured log warning per duplicate that names the conflicting OIDs — both map entries remain visible in logs
  3. `IOidMapService.ResolveToOid("obp_channel_L1")` returns the correct OID string; `ResolveToOid("no-such-name")` returns null
  4. The reverse index is rebuilt atomically alongside the forward map on every hot-reload — a caller reading immediately after reload sees the new reverse map, never a partial state
  5. Validation runs before `OidMapService.UpdateMap` is called so that duplicate-warning log entries are never followed by contradictory "added" diff entries for the same load event

**Plans:** 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 30-01-PLAN.md — Reverse index and ResolveToOid (OidMapService + IOidMapService + tests)
- [x] 30-02-PLAN.md — Duplicate OID/name validation in OidMapWatcherService + tests

---

#### Phase 31: Human-Name Device Config

**Goal**: Operators can reference metric names like "obp_channel_L1" instead of raw OID strings in devices.json poll entries, with full replacement of the Oids field by MetricNames and graceful handling of unresolvable names. Restructure oidmaps.json from flat dictionary to array of objects with explicit Oid/MetricName fields.
**Depends on**: Phase 30 (`IOidMapService.ResolveToOid` must exist before DeviceRegistry can call it)
**Requirements**: DEV-01, DEV-02, DEV-03, DEV-04, DEV-05, DEV-06, DEV-07
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. A devices.json poll entry with `MetricNames: ["obp_channel_L1", "obp_r1_power_L1"]` starts polling both OIDs after device config load — MetricPollJob never receives metric name strings as OID arguments
  2. A MetricNames[] entry that has no match in the current OID map logs a structured warning with device name and metric name, and that entry is silently skipped — the device's other poll entries still register normally
  3. When device config reloads, names are resolved against the current OID map state at that moment (point-in-time resolution)
  4. Reload diff logging includes per-name resolution detail (resolved count, unresolved names listed)

**Plans:** 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 31-01-PLAN.md — OidMap array restructure + C# model rename (PollOptions, Polls, MetricNames)
- [x] 31-02-PLAN.md — Name resolution in DeviceRegistry via IOidMapService + unit tests
- [x] 31-03-PLAN.md — Config file rewrite (devices.json, K8s ConfigMaps, E2E fixtures, E2E scenarios)

---

#### Phase 32: Command Map Infrastructure

**Goal**: A command map lookup table is operational — operators can load commandmaps.json via ConfigMap hot-reload or local file, and any in-process code can resolve a command name to its SET OID or vice versa
**Depends on**: Nothing (fully independent of Phases 30 and 31)
**Requirements**: CMD-01, CMD-02, CMD-03, CMD-04, CMD-05, CMD-06
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `CommandMapService.ResolveCommandOid("set-power-threshold")` returns the correct OID string; an unknown name returns null — both forward (OID → name) and reverse (name → OID) lookups work without throwing
  2. Updating the simetra-commandmaps ConfigMap in K8s triggers a hot-reload within seconds — structured diff log entries appear in pod logs showing added, removed, and changed command entries, plus total entry count
  3. In local dev mode (no K8s cluster), `CommandMapService` is populated from `config/commandmaps.json` on startup — no empty-map silent failure
  4. Loading a commandmaps.json with a duplicate OID key or a duplicate command name produces a structured warning per duplicate — same validation behavior as OID map integrity (Phase 30)
  5. The simetra-commandmaps ConfigMap manifest exists in the deploy directory and is ready to apply to the cluster

**Plans:** 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 32-01-PLAN.md — ICommandMapService + CommandMapService + commandmaps.json + 12 unit tests
- [x] 32-02-PLAN.md — simetra-commandmaps K8s ConfigMap manifests (standalone + production)
- [x] 32-03-PLAN.md — CommandMapWatcherService + DI wiring + local dev fallback + 10 validation tests

### 🚧 v1.10 Heartbeat Refactor & Pipeline Liveness (In Progress)

**Milestone Goal:** Remove hardcoded heartbeat special cases from the tenant and fan-out layers, then replace the old liveness signal with a pipeline-arrival timestamp that proves the full MediatR chain is working — all without changing the heartbeat job, trap wire format, or job-completion stamping.

#### Phase 43: Heartbeat Cleanup

**Goal**: The codebase contains no hardcoded heartbeat tenant or bypass routing — the heartbeat message flows through the pipeline naturally, skipped by fan-out because "Simetra" is not a registered device, and `TenantCount` reflects only config-driven tenants
**Depends on**: Nothing (cleanup before new liveness is added)
**Requirements**: HB-01, HB-02, HB-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `TenantVectorRegistry.Reload` contains no heartbeat holder, heartbeat tenant, `int.MinValue` priority bucket, or heartbeat carry-over logic — the registry reflects only what was loaded from config
  2. `TenantVectorFanOutBehavior` contains no `if (DeviceName == HeartbeatDeviceName)` block — the "Simetra" device name simply returns false from `TryGetDeviceByName` and fan-out is skipped without a special case
  3. `TenantCount` returns only the count of config-driven tenants — it no longer inflates the count by 1 for the synthetic heartbeat tenant
  4. All existing tests pass with no new failures after the removal — the heartbeat pipeline continues to process without the bypass

**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 43-01: Remove hardcoded heartbeat tenant from TenantVectorRegistry + adjust TenantCount + tests

---

#### Phase 44: Pipeline Liveness

**Goal**: The liveness health probe detects pipeline stalls by stamping a timestamp when the heartbeat message exits `OtelMetricHandler`, and reports unhealthy when that timestamp is more than `DefaultIntervalSeconds × GraceMultiplier` seconds stale — while confirming all preserved behaviors (job-completion stamping, heartbeat job wire format, OID map seed) remain intact
**Depends on**: Phase 43 (heartbeat bypass must be removed before stamp logic is added to OtelMetricHandler)
**Requirements**: HB-04, HB-05, HB-06, HB-07, HB-08, HB-09, HB-10
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `IHeartbeatLivenessService.Stamp()` is called inside `OtelMetricHandler` when `DeviceName == HeartbeatJobOptions.HeartbeatDeviceName` — the timestamp advances on every heartbeat cycle
  2. The liveness health check returns healthy when `now - lastArrival <= 30s` (15s interval × 2.0 grace) and unhealthy when the gap exceeds 30s — no hardcoded magic numbers; values come from `HeartbeatJobOptions.DefaultIntervalSeconds` and the default `GraceMultiplier`
  3. `ILivenessVectorService.Stamp()` in `HeartbeatJob.finally` is unchanged — all scheduled jobs continue stamping on completion as before
  4. `HeartbeatJob` sends the same SNMP trap with OID `1.3.6.1.4.1.9999.1.1.1.0`, Source=Trap, community `"Simetra.Simetra"` — no wire-format change
  5. The `"Heartbeat"` metric name seed in `OidMapService` survives hot-reload — the OID map always resolves the heartbeat OID to `"Heartbeat"`

**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 44-01: IHeartbeatLivenessService + stamp point in OtelMetricHandler + tests
- [ ] 44-02: Liveness health check using pipeline-arrival timestamp + tests
